## 📂 Project Structure

### Backend (`/backend`)

The backend is built with FastAPI and handles the core scanning logic, database interactions, and AI processing.

- **`app/main.py`**: The entry point of the application.
- **`app/services/scan_manager.py`**: The core engine that orchestrates the scanning process.
- **`app/services/event_manager.py`**: Manages Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time updates.
- **`app/services/tools.py`**: Handles SSH connections to execute security tools.
- **`prisma/schema.prisma`**: Defines the database schema (Users, Scans, Results).

### Frontend (`/frontend`)

The frontend is a modern React application providing a responsive and interactive user interface.

- **`src/context/SSEContext.tsx`**: Manages the global real-time event stream.
- **`src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`**: High-level statistics and active scan monitoring.
- **`src/pages/ScanDetails.tsx`**: Detailed view of scan progress, results, and AI analysis.
- **`src/pages/History.tsx`**: Searchable archive of past scans.

## 🔒 Security Note
